### TODO list:

-	Fix double work in finding inside PairVector, when we know data is not last element...
-	Make HGET / HLEN etc to give proper error when counter is exausted.
-	make tests for IX456
-	protect db_net save with mutex, just in case of overwritting the buffers.
-	make advice on buffers when db_net save (was removed for hash index)
