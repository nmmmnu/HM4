Flushlist guarantees under normal operations

- Pair will be always inserted, even in case of flush
- All references to any dynamic data will be kept until pair is inserted / created.
  In case of list flush, insert will be done in a buffer,
  after the flush, the buffer will be cloned into the list.
- However, if you have two or more consequtive inserts,
  this guarantee apply only for the first mutation. e.g XNDEL
